"Web design is 95% typography" — Oliver Reichenstein

When that quote was made in 2006 it was before web fonts, auto-play video,
and animated pop-ups so even if it is 65 or 75% today that is still *most* 
of any web site's design. Understanding some of the basics of typography
(and web typography) will go a long way.

There are lots of web typographic systems out there however many are
overly complex and not intuitive. Thus, we've tried to set some good
defaults that aren't based on confounding mixins here but you may want
to explore web typography further:

Note that most of the typography styles are set in base.scss with
the html, body, and h1–h6 tags so adjust as needed. Set a good baseline
and consider your vertical rhythm.
